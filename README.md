# Tennis-App
I developed an application to track tennis players stats, graph match data (like first serve wins), and scrape the web for relevant news (supports four major tennis sites), using python for the frontend and mysql for the backend.

Fields: Name, Age, Rank, WL Ratio, Achievements, and an image of the player.

This is what the home page looks like

Comes with slider button to click through player profiles and well as full CRUD capabilities.

^^ Example player profile

The program also includes a list view for these records as well as search functionality

Graphing match data such as first serve wins is also a use of this app. 

In the analysis menu, the user may click 'new analysis' to open this window
