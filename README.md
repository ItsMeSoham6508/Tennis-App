# Tennis-App
I developed an application to track tennis players stats, graph match data (like first serve wins), and scrape the web for relevant news (supports four major tennis sites), using python for the frontend and mysql for the backend.

Fields: Name, Age, Rank, WL Ratio, Achievements, and an image of the player.

This is what the home page looks like
